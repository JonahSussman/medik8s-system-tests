# FAR Operator Post-Deployment Tests

Automated tests validating the Fence Agents Remediation (FAR) operator deployment, security posture, and high-availability configuration.

## Prerequisites

- OpenShift cluster with FAR operator installed via OLM
- `KUBECONFIG` set with cluster-admin access
- FAR installed in `openshift-workload-availability` namespace

## Running

```bash
ginkgo --label-filter="far" ./tests/far-operator/...
```

## Tests

Creates a FAR CR without the `--action` parameter in shared parameters. Validates that FAR defaults to the reboot action and the node is successfully rebooted.

- **Operators**: FAR v0.8.0+
- **Cluster**: AWS IPI, 3+ worker nodes
- **Storage**: None
- **Environment**: Connected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="far && disruption:destructive" --focus="action is omitted" ./tests/far-operator/...`

- **Cluster**: Multi-node, 2+ controller replicas
- **Storage**: None
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="far" --focus="controller leadership" ./tests/far-operator/...`

### 16. Verify FAR Operator Survives OCP and Operator Upgrade ([OCP-89717](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-89717))

Validates the full customer upgrade path: install GA FAR from redhat-operators on OCP N-1, upgrade OCP to N, run remediation to confirm GA operator works on upgraded cluster, switch Subscription to Konflux FBC catalog (pre-GA), and run remediation again to confirm upgraded operator works. Each remediation cycle creates a workload pod on the target node, fences the node via fence_aws, and verifies node reboot, recovery, and workload eviction via OutOfServiceTaint.

- **Operators**: FAR GA (from redhat-operators) + FAR pre-GA (from Konflux FBC)
- **Cluster**: AWS IPI, 3+ worker nodes, OCP N-1 at start (upgraded to N during test)
- **Storage**: None
- **Environment**: Connected
- **Labels**: `tier:upgrade`, `disruption:destructive`, `platform:aws`, `frequency:weekly`, `component:olm`
- **Env vars (required)**: `OPENSHIFT_UPGRADE_RELEASE_IMAGE_OVERRIDE` (falls back to `RELEASE_IMAGE_LATEST` if unset)
- **CI prerequisite**: `medik8s-catalogsource` step must run before the test (creates the `medik8s-catalog` CatalogSource)
- **Env vars (optional, have defaults)**: `MEDIK8S_OPERATOR_PACKAGE` (default: `fence-agents-remediation`), `MEDIK8S_TARGET_CHANNEL` (default: `stable`)
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="far && tier:upgrade" ./tests/far-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: FAR deployment Ready on OCP N-1, OCP upgrade completes (Progressing=False, Available=True, Degraded=False), FAR deployment Ready after OCP upgrade, FAR CSV in Succeeded phase after catalog switch (new CSV if Konflux version is higher than GA, same CSV if versions match), controller image changes after operator upgrade (skipped on version parity), remediation succeeds after OCP upgrade and after catalog switch (node rebooted via boot ID change, node recovers to Ready), workload pods evicted after each fencing cycle
